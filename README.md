# JackPoint
A character sheet repository and viewer for Shadowrun 5th Edition, in combination with Chummer.

JackPoint is designed with intent to allow users to store and view Shadowrun 5th Edition character sheets created via Chummer.

## Why JackPoint Exists
I decided to make JackPoint after coming to the realization I really don't like the way Chummer lays out character sheets, and deciding I wanted a way to have a more aesthetically-pleasing method of organizing and viewing my Shadowrunners.

## Build Status
Jackpoint is not at this time built.

## Tech/Framework used
**Built with:**
- [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/ "RedwoodJS Website")
- [Chummer5a](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a "Chummer community branch")

## Features
JackPoint is being designed to take in a JSON input from Chummer, and output a responsive character sheet from the result.

## Tests
At this time, JackPoint does not have working tests, as it has yet to be properly built and deployed.

## Contributing
As long as you can explain clearly what you've added and show that it will positively contribute to the development of the project, it'll probably get merged in.
